title: COVID-19
description: Harming a relatively large number of healthy people with experimental policies of undemonstrated effectiveness in the name of a relatively small number of people who might be harmed if we didn't is, amongst many other things, a violation of fundamental ethics. The bizarre phenomena it's spawned, such as authoritarianism, cults, pseudoscience, moral panic, McCarthyism, Lysenkoism, Reflexive Law, and The Great Reset are fascinating.
