summary: The UK's pandemic preparedness strategy rejected lockdowns. Government says lockdown kills more people than COVID-19. What changed?

It's not possible to stop the spread of, or eradicate, infectious respiratory disease, and it's a waste of public health resources and capacity to try. There's very limited scientific evidence that restrictions on mass gatherings have any significant effect on virus transmission. Even a 99.9% international travel restriction might delay the pandemic wave by only a month or two, and there should be no plan to close borders. There's very little evidence of widespread benefit from the wearing by the public of facemasks.

This was the advice given by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) to the UK Government a year ago today (4th February 2020). In the minutes of the Fourth SAGE meeting on Wuhan Coronavirus held on 4th February[^SAGE2020], they wrote: _"6. SAGE agreed that HMG should continue to plan using current influenza pandemic assumptions, which can be modified as data becomes more certain"._

The assumptions were set out in the Department of Health's *"UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011"*[^1] documenting the UK-wide strategic approach to responding to a respiratory illness pandemic. The strategy was developed jointly across the four UK Governments by NHS, social care, and public health organisations, and based on advice from clinical and scientific experts. Written for an influenza pandemic, the strategy noted that the plans were suitable for other infectious diseases with altogether different patterns of infectivity, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

The "reasonable worst case" scenario assumed that up to 2.5% of those with symptoms would die as a result of infection. It noted that, in both the 2009 and 1999/2000 influenza seasons, day-to-day life for most people continued largely unaffected. The objective was to _"Minimise the potential impact of a pandemic on society and the economy by promoting a return to normality and the restoration of disrupted services at the earliest opportunity"_. Government policy was unambiguous: _"The UK Government does not plan to close borders, stop mass gatherings or impose controls on public transport during any pandemic"_.

By early March, estimates[^IFR] of the fatality rate were showing far lower values than the scenario assumption in the Strategy (0.3% vs. 2.5%). By the middle of March 2020, the growth rate of new fatal infections (modelled from recorded deaths) had fallen to zero.

## The reversal, and its costs

Yet on 16th March, the Health and Social Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that "unnecessary social contact" should cease. On 23rd March 2020, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people that they "must stay at home", and commenced a policy of mandatory business closures and stay-at-home notices that continue to this day. 

In July 2020, The Office of National Statistics published a summary[^ONS2020] of estimates of the deaths caused by the economic, medical, and mental health impacts of this new policy. It estimated that a 2 month lockdown would cause 200,000 such deaths, noting that _"...when morbidity is taken into account, the estimates for the health impacts from a lockdown and lockdown induced recession are greater in terms of [Quality Adjusted Life Years] than the direct COVID-19 deaths"_. 

This raises a very obvious and important question: why did the UK Government respond to an infectious respiratory disease pandemic caused by a virus with one tenth of the lethality assumed in existing strategic plans by overturning the rejection of lockdowns, and implement instead a policy estimated now to be the cause of death of between 200,000 and 560,000 people? 

The ONS study stated its reason: _"...without mitigations, a far larger number of people would have died from COVID-19"_. But this claim was based on two critical and wildly inaccurate assumptions: an estimate of an infection fatality rate of 4%, suggested by Professor Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London; and a lockdown duration of 2 months.

When data about the much lower infection fatality rate emerged, the ONS didn't reduce its estimate of COVID-19 deaths. When the lockdown was extended from 3 weeks to "flatten the curve", to the Autumn to "protect the NHS", to the winter to "allow the vaccine rollout", it didn't increase its estimate of poverty deaths. 

Using the relationship between Gross Domestic Product and life expectance, the Faculty of Public Risk at the University of Bristol estimated[^Thomas2020] that the recession created by the now 9% reduction in GDP would cause in the long run the loss of up to 560,000 lives in the UK due to lockdown policies. By comparison, they estimated that 45,000 lives (converted to equivalent life expectancies) would have been lost to COVID-19 if no mitigations were made.

## "We couldn’t get away with it in Europe"

The motive for failing to update the cost/benefit analysis of the lockdown will be a matter for a future Public Enquiry to examine. The opportunity that led to the change, however, is clear.  Professor Neil Ferguson[^Times2020]:

"‘[China] is a communist one-party state,’ we said. ‘We couldn’t get away with it in Europe,’ we thought. And then Italy did it. And we realised we could."

Professor Ferguson was forced to resign in disgrace from SAGE for seriously violating the stay-at-home order he was instrumental in imposing on others. Tragically, however, the failure to understand the limits of models, and of the modellers, was already recognised. In her independent review of the 2009 influenza pandemic, Dame Hine said[^Hine2009]:

{{< blockquote >}}
Early and emerging data should always be of some use, but its employment should be carefully managed. This is not to reject the use of models, but to understand its limitations: modellers are not ‘court astrologers’.
{{< /blockquote >}}

Additionally:

{{< blockquote >}}
Decision-makers must not rely on the model to make a decision for them but be prepared to use it as part of a process in which other factors, such as the “riskiness” of a policy, are weighed
{{< /blockquote >}}

Time will show the catastrophic harm that this "risky" policy created. We can only wonder now at what might have been if Government had recalled Dame Hine's recommendations. It's essential that they do so next time.
