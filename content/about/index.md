*Hello*. Welcome to my personal website. This is where I write about things that interest me, in a place where I can share it with others. Things that interest me include our energy predicament and, more recently, the peculiar phenomenon of Covid-19 hysteria.

Writing is how I clarify my thoughts. It's easy to have an opinion on things; it's harder to have an opinion that is coherent, logical, and evidence based. Often, I'll abandon an essay when I realise I still don't understand the topic well enough to publish it online. This is the value of this website to me.

I write in short-essay form. Where I can, I supply references to claims I make. There is a huge amount of misinformation and disinformation now. I can't avoid being wrong from time to time, but at least I can show where I obtained by information from, to allow you to make your own judgement about my argument. 

I do make mistakes, and sometimes I change my mind. For example, I once thought Marxism was a good idea --- common enough until you actually study it. But I'm writing in good faith, and I assume that you are reading in good faith. I provide the ability to comment on most of my essays, and you can contact me at the email in the footer. So if you see something obviously wrong, or that you believe is misleading, contact me with a reason and I'll make a note.

My competence is as a generalist in numerically intensive disciplines. I have an undergraduate degree in Physics and Electronics, and Masters Degrees separately in Petroleum Engineering, and in Economics. I'm happy to speculate on matters outside those areas, for example in epidemiology, where my opinion relies on reasoning and data rather than domain-specific knowledge. So for example: I can't design a vaccine; I can evaluate the significance of mass-administration of an experimental vaccine technology with a long-term safety trial that doesn't finish for another two years. 

Best wishes,
